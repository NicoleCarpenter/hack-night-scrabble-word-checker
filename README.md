# Scrabble Word Checker & Word Unscrambler

## Gameplay

There are two requirements for tonight's Hack Night, a word checker, and a word unscrambler. You will need to find and encorporate an open source Scrabble dictionary.

### Word Checker

Allow a user to enter a word and check if it is a valid Scrabble word.

### Word Unscrambler

Allow a user to enter a set of letters and return a list of valid Scrabble words using those letters. In addition to entering letters, users can indicate a '?' as a wildcard option.

Users should be given the option to indicate that they want the words to start with or end with one or more letters, or that the results should contain a particular set of letters in an order they indicat. They can also specify letters that must be included in the results.
